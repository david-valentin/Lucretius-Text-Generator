		ABSTRACT : "What makes a philosopher a philosopher? What makes their writing identifiably unique or characteristically special. Disregarding education levels and literacy levels in the Ancient world, at the end of the day, Roman philosophers are able to construct and derive meaning philosophical meaning from the same set of words that everyone has access to. My project will go into addressing some of these questions and identifying the texts of Lucretius. ",
		MATERIALS_AND_METHODS : "I'll be sampling the writings of Lucretius. We will sample their respective Latin texts and English translations from Tufts Perseus Library and feed it into Markov Model which will analyze all his books, and produce 5 sentences. We will be using two primary Ruby libraries to handle the natural language processing: Classifier Reborn and Markov Chains.",
		MARKOV_CHAINS : "A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.",
		BAYESIAN_ANALYSIS : "The problem with the above formulation is that if the number of features n is large or if a feature can take on a large number of values, then basing such a model on probability tables is infeasible. We therefore reformulate the model to make it more tractable. Using Bayes' theorem, the conditional probability can be decomposed as ",
		RESULTS : "The results were mixed. The Markov Model for text generation occassionally generated sentences but then sometimes wouldn't. This is also dependent on the text input since we know that some parts of Lucretius' writings are missing. Moreoever, it is interesting how the generator was able to capture the poetic nature of Lucretius' texts. The main issue with the model was that it had trouble distinguishing capital letters should be new sentences however since my markov chain treats all words the same it produces it as such.",

		CONCLUSION : "Although it is possible to generate 'philosophical' text or even poetry, the ability to produce hunches and these ficionalized concepts and create a belief system is not. I think that is what is most inherrently fascinating from Lucretius' texts is that he is able to construct a different realm far from the knowledge base of that of his ancient world and his understanding of it.",
