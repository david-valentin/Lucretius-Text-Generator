# Lucretius Text Generator and Classifier

What makes a philosopher a philosopher? What makes their writing identifiably unique or special? Disregarding education levels and literacy levels in the Ancient world, Roman philosophers are able to construct and derive philosophical meaning from the same set of words that everyone has access to. My project will go into addressing some of these questions and identifying the historical text and what makes Lucretius’ writing uniquely Lucretius’. I will be building a web application that analyzes Lucretius’ books and creates several Markov chains which look at the probability of the words that follow each other in order to generate text and utilizing a Ruby library that leverages Naïve Bayes analysis to classify text. The purpose of this short project was to blend both my major in Computer Science and my minor Classics to take a look at the how philosophy could be generated.
